This project has come from the basic idea to manage student data /information in an automated way rather than to manage it manually .
The implementations include Java swing concept  and My SQL database that will allow us to insert , update and delete data.
Furthermore ,this project can be expanded to store large amount of student data such as marks,records of academic achievements and many more.
As of now , it is designed only to store the basic details of students such as Name ,Roll number,Department ,Date of Birth and Password.
